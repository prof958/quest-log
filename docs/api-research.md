# Game API Research & Analysis

## API Comparison Summary

### RAWG API (Recommended Choice) ‚úÖ
**Strengths:**
- **Free Tier**: 20,000 requests/month (excellent for our needs)
- **Comprehensive Data**: 500,000+ games with rich metadata
- **Simple Setup**: Just requires API key, no complex authentication
- **Rich Features**: Ratings, screenshots, genres, platforms, ESRB ratings
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and improvements
- **Community Support**: Good documentation and community wrappers
- **Search Capabilities**: Fuzzy search, exact search, filtering by multiple criteria
- **Performance**: Fast response times and reliable uptime

**Limitations:**
- Requires attribution/backlinks to RAWG
- 20k requests/month limit (but sufficient for our use case)
- No commercial use beyond 100k MAU without upgrade ($149/month)

**Perfect for our needs**: Local caching + smart request management can easily stay within 20k limit

### Steam Web API ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Strengths:**
- **Massive Database**: All Steam games with official data
- **Free**: No usage fees for basic endpoints
- **Reliable**: Backed by Valve infrastructure
- **Accurate**: Official game data directly from Steam

**Limitations:**
- **Complex Authentication**: Requires Steam API key and potentially user authentication
- **Limited Public Access**: Many useful endpoints require publisher keys
- **Steam-Only**: Missing games not on Steam platform
- **CORS Issues**: May have same browser limitations we faced before
- **Rate Limiting**: Strict limits, especially for non-publishers

**Verdict**: Too complex for our "no server" requirement

### Giant Bomb API ‚ùå
**Strengths:**
- **Rich Editorial Content**: Professional reviews and detailed metadata
- **Well Curated**: High-quality, structured wiki-style data
- **Mature API**: Long-established with good documentation

**Limitations:**
- **Non-Commercial Only**: Strict non-commercial restriction
- **Low Rate Limits**: Only 200 requests/resource/hour
- **Attribution Required**: Must link back to Giant Bomb
- **Limited Coverage**: Smaller database compared to RAWG/Steam

**Verdict**: Too restrictive for our growth plans

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: RAWG API Integration with Smart Caching
```
Hybrid Architecture:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Local Popular Games (Instant - 50 games)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RAWG API (Search & Discovery)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Local Cache (Search Results & Details) 
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Background Sync (Popular Games Updates)
```

### Implementation Plan:

#### 1. Enhanced Local Database
- Expand current popular-games.json to 50-100 curated games
- Add RAWG IDs for seamless integration
- Keep current instant search for popular titles

#### 2. RAWG Service Integration
```typescript
class RAWGService {
  private cache = new Map(); // In-memory cache
  
  async searchGames(query: string): Promise<Game[]> {
    // Check cache first
    if (this.cache.has(query)) return this.cache.get(query);
    
    // Fetch from RAWG API
    const results = await this.fetchFromRAWG(query);
    
    // Cache results locally
    this.cache.set(query, results);
    return results;
  }
}
```

#### 3. Request Management Strategy
- **Smart Caching**: Cache all search results locally
- **Popular Games Priority**: Serve from local database first
- **Batch Requests**: Combine multiple game lookups when possible
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor API usage to stay within 20k/month limit

#### 4. Fallback Strategy
```
Search Flow:
1. Check Local Popular Games (instant)
2. Check Local Cache (fast)
3. Search RAWG API (if under rate limit)
4. Fallback to "Game not found" with manual entry option
```

### Technical Benefits
- **Performance**: Local cache provides instant results for repeated searches
- **Reliability**: Works offline with cached data
- **Scalability**: Can easily upgrade to Business plan ($149/m) if needed
- **User Experience**: Progressive enhancement - works without internet
- **Cost**: Free for our expected usage level

### Risk Mitigation
- **Rate Limit Protection**: Built-in usage tracking and throttling
- **Attribution Compliance**: Add "Powered by RAWG" attribution
- **Data Backup**: Local popular games as fallback
- **Upgrade Path**: Clear path to paid tier if we exceed limits
