- [x] Foundation phase planning started

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [x] Development environment setup
- [x] Project structure initialization
- [x] Core dependency configuration
- [x] Login screen setup
- [ ] Supabase project creation and configuration

### ðŸ“‹ Planned (Foundation Phase)
- [x] React Native + Expo project setup
- [x] TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Supabase project creation and configuration
- [ ] RAWG API integration setup
- [ ] Basic navigation structure
- [ ] Retro theme system implementation
- [ ] Authentication flow setup
- [ ] Core data models and database schema

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Phase Goals (MVP)
- [ ] Game logging functionality
- [ ] Basic XP system
- [ ] Simple quest mechanics

- [ ] Game search and selection

### Known Issues
- None yet - project in initialization phase

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Mobile-First**: React Native for cross-platform mobile
2. **Backend**: Supabase for database, auth, and real-time features
3. **Game Data**: RAWG API for comprehensive game metadata
4. **State Management**: Start with React Context, evolve as needed
5. **Styling**: Custom retro theme system
6. **Development**: Expo for rapid iteration and deployment

### Key Learnings
- Memory bank system will be essential for maintaining project continuity
- Retro aesthetic impacts both visual design and UX interaction patterns
- Mobile performance constraints must drive all technical decisions
- Foundation phase architecture decisions are critical for scalability

### Evolution Notes
- Started with clear vision: "Letterboxd for games" with retro handheld feel
- Established collaborative, building-focused workflow
- Prioritized practical iteration over extensive upfront planning
- Memory bank documentation pattern ensures project continuity
