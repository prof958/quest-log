### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Mobile-First**: React Native for cross-platform mobile
2. **Backend**: Supabase for database, auth, and real-time features
3. **Game Data**: RAWG API for comprehensive game metadata
4. **State Management**: Start with React Context, evolve as needed
5. **Styling**: Custom retro theme system with cozy, friendly aesthetic
6. **Development**: Expo for rapid iteration and deployment
7. **Documentation**: Organized in docs/ folder for user guidance

### Key Learnings
- Memory bank system essential for project continuity
- Cozy, friendly aesthetic over harsh retro styling works better
- Progressive disclosure in login improves UX
- Supabase JWT secrets are managed automatically
- Documentation organization improves workflow

### Evolution Notes
- Started with clear vision: "Letterboxd for games" with cozy gaming feel
- Shifted from harsh retro to warm, friendly aesthetic
- Established collaborative, building-focused workflow
- Created comprehensive documentation structure in docs/
- Login flow uses progressive disclosure (Begin Adventure â†’ Auth Options)
