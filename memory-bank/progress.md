### üîÑ In Progress  
- [ ] User game library integration with Supabase
- [ ] Mobile performance optimization and testing

### üìã Planned (Next Iteration)
- [ ] Enhanced game database solution (automated/API-based approach)
- [ ] Complete Supabase user library integration
- [ ] Game status tracking (wishlist, playing, completed, etc.)
- [ ] Enhanced search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Mobile-optimized UI improvements
- [ ] User game progress logging features
- [ ] Social features and game recommendations

### üéØ Next Phase Goals (Enhanced Game Library)
- Replace manual local database with automated solution
- Implement comprehensive game search with rich metadata
- Complete user library persistence with Supabase
- Add game discovery and recommendation features
- Optimize mobile performance and user experience

### üîç Technical Lessons Learned
- CORS restrictions make browser-based external API integration challenging
- Local-first approach provides better performance and reliability
- User preferences heavily favor simplicity over feature complexity
- Manual database curation is not scalable long-term
- Service layer abstraction (LocalGameService) enables easy migration between approaches
- [ ] Game logging functionality
- [ ] Basic XP system
- [ ] Simple quest mechanics
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Game search and selection

### Known Issues
- Database schema JWT permission issue resolved ‚úÖ
- OAuth providers need configuration in external consoles resolved ‚úÖ  
- AuthSessionMissingError on app startup resolved ‚úÖ
- Expo development build mode preventing QR code launch resolved ‚úÖ
- Git PATH configuration resolved ‚úÖ

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Mobile-First**: React Native for cross-platform mobile, web for testing
2. **Backend**: Supabase for database, auth, and real-time features
3. **Game Data**: RAWG API for comprehensive game metadata
4. **State Management**: React Context with comprehensive auth state management
5. **Authentication**: Google OAuth primary, email/password fallback
6. **Styling**: Custom retro theme system with cozy, friendly aesthetic
7. **Development**: Expo for rapid iteration and deployment
8. **Documentation**: Organized in docs/ folder with detailed setup guides
9. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging throughout authentication flows

### Key Learnings
- Memory bank system essential for project continuity
- Cozy, friendly aesthetic over harsh retro styling works better
- Progressive disclosure in login improves UX
- Supabase JWT secrets are managed automatically
- Documentation organization improves workflow
- OAuth implementation simpler with Supabase's built-in providers
- Comprehensive logging crucial for debugging authentication issues
- Web platform testing valuable for rapid iteration during travel constraints

### Evolution Notes
- Started with clear vision: "Letterboxd for games" with cozy gaming feel
- Shifted from harsh retro to warm, friendly aesthetic
- Established collaborative, building-focused workflow
- Created comprehensive documentation structure in docs/
- Login flow uses progressive disclosure (Begin Adventure ‚Üí Auth Options)
- Implemented complete OAuth integration with Google Console setup
- Enhanced project documentation with detailed README and setup guides
- Memory bank system proving essential for project continuity and context preservation
- Documentation-driven development approach ensuring knowledge retention across sessions
- Comprehensive logging strategy established for debugging authentication flows
