- **Platform**: Mobile-first, cross-platform

## Design Philosophy
- **Retro Handheld OS Aesthetic**: Pixel fonts, low-contrast palette, CRT effects
- **Tactile Feedback**: Light sound effects and animations
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable component structure
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile devices

## Development Approach
- Iterative phases (Foundation → MVP → Playtest → Polish)
- Short, practical development cycles
- Focus on building over planning
- Collaborative builder relationship

## Success Criteria
- Functional game logging system
- Engaging gamification mechanics
- Authentic retro handheld experience
- Smooth mobile performance
- Extensible architecture for future features
