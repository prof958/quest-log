# QuestLog - Product Context

## Why QuestLog Exists
Gaming culture lacks a dedicated social platform for tracking and discovering games. Current solutions are either too complex (backlog apps) or too simplistic (lists). QuestLog fills the gap by combining:
- **Social Discovery**: Like Letterboxd's film community
- **Personal Progress**: Meaningful tracking beyond "played/not played"
- **Gamification**: Making tracking itself enjoyable and rewarding

## Problems We Solve
1. **Game Discovery**: Hard to find quality games matching preferences
2. **Progress Tracking**: No unified way to log gaming journey
3. **Motivation**: Playing games feels less rewarding without recognition
4. **Community**: Missing social layer for gaming experiences
5. **Organization**: Game libraries scattered across platforms

## How It Should Work
### Core Loop
1. **Log Game**: Quick entry with rating, status, playtime
2. **Earn XP**: Points for logging, reviewing, completing games
3. **Complete Quests**: "Play 5 indie games", "Write 10 reviews"
4. **Level Up**: Unlock new features, badges, customization
5. **Share Progress**: Connect with friends, compare achievements

### User Experience Goals
- **Instant Gratification**: Immediate XP/feedback for every action
- **Nostalgic Feel**: Authentic retro handheld console experience
- **Effortless Entry**: Logging games should take < 30 seconds
- **Meaningful Progress**: Each level/badge represents real engagement
- **Social Connection**: Easy sharing without social media complexity

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Gaming enthusiasts who want to track their hobby
- **Secondary**: Social gamers looking for community and discovery
- **Tertiary**: Completionists and collectors who love progression systems
