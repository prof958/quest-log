# QuestLog - Active Context

## Current Focus: Foundation Phase
**Objective**: Set up development environment and core project structure

## Recent Discussions
- Initial project concept defined: "Letterboxd for games" with retro handheld aesthetic
- Tech stack confirmed: React Native + Supabase + RAWG API
- Memory bank system initialized based on AGENTS.md workflow
- Development approach: Iterative phases, building-focused collaboration

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Initialize React Native project with Expo
   - Configure TypeScript and essential tooling
   - Set up Supabase project and local development
   - Create basic project structure

2. **Foundation Components**
   - Retro theme system (colors, fonts, effects)
   - Navigation structure (tabs + stack)
   - Basic authentication flow
   - RAWG API integration setup

3. **Core Data Models**
   - User profile schema
   - Game entry schema  
   - XP/Quest system schema
   - Database migrations

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- **State Management**: Leaning toward React Context + useReducer for simplicity, may upgrade to Redux Toolkit if complexity grows
- **Offline Strategy**: SQLite for critical data, queue system for sync
- **Theme System**: CSS-in-JS vs styled-components for retro styling
- **Testing Strategy**: Focus on integration tests for core user flows

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Mobile-First**: All decisions prioritize mobile UX
- **Retro Aesthetic**: Every UI decision should feel authentic to handheld consoles
- **Performance**: 60fps target, bundle size awareness
- **Modularity**: Keep components small, focused, reusable
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work offline

## Current Blockers/Questions
- Need to confirm specific retro color palette preferences
- RAWG API rate limits and caching strategy details
- Quest system complexity - start simple or build robust framework?

## Key Insights
- Memory bank system will be crucial for maintaining context across sessions
- Foundation phase is critical - get architecture right early
- Retro aesthetic isn't just visual - affects UX patterns and interaction design
- Mobile performance constraints will drive technical decisions

## Collaboration Style
- Short, practical responses
- Focus on building over extensive planning
- Ask clarifying questions when decisions impact architecture
- Maintain iterative approach with clear phase boundaries
