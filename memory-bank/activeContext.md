# QuestLog - Active Context

## Current Focus: OAuth Testing & Validation
**Objective**: Test and validate the complete Google OAuth authentication implementation

## Recent Discussions
- Google OAuth integration completed with comprehensive implementation
- Supabase OAuth provider configured with Google Console
- Extensive logging added throughout authentication flow for debugging
- Complete OAuth documentation created (docs/OAUTH_CONFIGURATION.md)
- README enhanced with project overview and documentation links
- Web platform testing setup validated (localhost:8081)

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **OAuth Testing**
   - Test Google OAuth button functionality on web platform
   - Verify complete authentication flow with logging
   - Validate OAuth return handling and session management
   - Confirm Supabase auth state updates

2. **Post-Authentication Flow**
   - Implement navigation to main app after successful auth
   - Create authenticated user experience
   - Set up protected route handling

3. **Game Logging Foundation**
   - Begin core game logging functionality
   - RAWG API integration for game search
   - Basic game entry forms

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Authentication Strategy**: Google OAuth primary, email/password fallback implemented
- **OAuth Testing**: Web platform first due to mobile testing constraints while traveling
- **Debugging Approach**: Comprehensive logging throughout auth flow for troubleshooting
- **Documentation Focus**: Creating detailed setup guides for OAuth configuration

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Mobile-First**: All decisions prioritize mobile UX, web for testing convenience
- **Cozy Aesthetic**: Friendly retro gaming feel over harsh pixel aesthetics
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Extensive debug information for authentication flows
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean service separation (AuthService, AuthContext)
- **Documentation-Driven**: Complete setup guides for complex integrations

## Current Blockers/Questions
- OAuth flow end-to-end testing needed to validate complete implementation
- Post-authentication navigation flow requires implementation
- Mobile platform OAuth testing will be needed once travel restrictions lifted

## Key Insights
- OAuth implementation simpler with Supabase's built-in provider support
- Comprehensive logging essential for debugging authentication issues
- Documentation creation crucial for preserving complex setup knowledge
- Web platform testing valuable for rapid iteration during development
- Google Console OAuth configuration straightforward but requires careful redirect URL setup

## Collaboration Style
- Implementation-focused with thorough testing
- Documentation of complex setups for future reference
- Iterative testing approach with comprehensive logging
- Building working solutions then documenting learnings
