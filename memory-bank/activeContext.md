# QuestLog - Active Context

## Current Focus: Local Game Database Implementation Complete
**Objective**: Successfully implemented local-first game database solution to replace external API dependencies

## Recent Discussions
- Attempted IGDB API integration but encountered CORS restrictions
- Explored Supabase Edge Functions but preferred avoiding server complexity
- User emphasized preference for no server-side components and easy mobile setup
- Successfully pivoted to local JSON database approach with curated game collection
- Completed migration from IGDBService to LocalGameService
- Project cleanup and organization completed

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Enhanced Game Library Solution**
   - Research automated game database solutions (Steam API, community APIs)
   - Implement more comprehensive game search and discovery
   - Add game categories, ratings, and rich metadata
   - Consider hybrid local/online approach for better coverage

2. **User Library Integration**
   - Complete Supabase integration for user game libraries
   - Add/remove games functionality with backend persistence
   - User game status tracking (wishlist, playing, completed)
   - Library sync across devices

3. **Core Features Development**
   - Game progress tracking and logging
   - Achievement and milestone recording
   - Social features (sharing, recommendations)
   - Enhanced UI/UX for mobile experience

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Game Database Strategy**: Local-first approach chosen over external APIs to avoid CORS and complexity
- **No Server Dependencies**: User preference for avoiding server-side components and maintaining simplicity
- **Supabase Free Tier**: Using existing Supabase only for user data, staying within free limits
- **Mobile Setup Priority**: Easy installation and setup on mobile devices is crucial
- **Performance Focus**: Local database provides instant search and better mobile performance

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Mobile-First**: All decisions prioritize mobile UX, web for testing convenience
- **Local-First Architecture**: Eliminate external dependencies where possible
- **Simple Setup**: Avoid complex server configurations or paid services
- **Service Layer Pattern**: LocalGameService provides IGDB-compatible interface
- **Cozy Aesthetic**: Friendly retro gaming feel over harsh pixel aesthetics
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Memory bank system for project continuity

## Current Blockers/Questions
- Local game database is manually curated and limited in scope
- Need scalable solution for comprehensive game coverage
- User library integration with Supabase needs completion and testing
- Mobile performance optimization and testing required

## Key Insights
- CORS restrictions make browser-based API calls challenging for game databases
- Local-first approach provides better performance and reliability
- User strongly prefers simplicity over feature complexity
- Manual database curation is not sustainable long-term
- Comprehensive logging essential for debugging authentication issues
- Documentation creation crucial for preserving complex setup knowledge
- Web platform testing valuable for rapid iteration during development
- Google Console OAuth configuration straightforward but requires careful redirect URL setup

## Collaboration Style
- Implementation-focused with thorough testing
- Documentation of complex setups for future reference
- Iterative testing approach with comprehensive logging
- Building working solutions then documenting learnings
